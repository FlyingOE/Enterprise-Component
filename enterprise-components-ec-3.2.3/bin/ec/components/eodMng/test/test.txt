For succesfull testing :
1. rdb with eodlib (currently in rdb branch "eodlib") should be downloaded from SVN repository 
   I    rdb.q should be placed in this directory
   II.  sub.q should be placed into lib_example directory
   III. eodlib.q should be placed into lib_example directory
2. yak.cfg should be edited so testing user should be able to manage processes (just edit sys_user at the first line of config and add your login)
3. create "lib" directory and copy contents of "lib_example" to it
4. Make sure your network is operable
5. run command : "sh test/test.sh"
6. test takes approx 1.5h, but it displays result of each test as it goes
7. after all tests it cleans after itself
